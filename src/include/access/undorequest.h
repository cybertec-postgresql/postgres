/*
 * FREE means that the UndoRequest object is not in use. It is available
 * to be allocated.
 *
 * ALLOCATED means that the UndoRequest object has been allocated but the
 * contents may not be valid yet (except for status, fxid, and dbid). It is
 * used for transactions that are still in progress.
 *
 * READY means that the UndoRequest object has valid contents but is not
 * eligible to be processed. It is used for prepared transactions, because
 * we don't know whether or not we'll actually need to process the undo
 * until they either commit or are rolled back.
 *
 * WAITING means that the UndoRequest object needs to be processed but is
 * not yet being processed. It is only used for transacions that have
 * aborted (including abort prepared)
 *
 * IN_PROGRESS means that the UndoRequest object is currently being
 * processed. Like WAITING, the transaction must have aborted.

/*
 * An UndoRequestData object stores the information that we must have in order
 * to perform background undo for a transaction. It may be stored in memory or
 * serialized to disk.
 *
 * However, a request should never be serialized to disk if the status is
 * UNDO_REQUEST_FREE or UNDO_REQUEST_ALLOCATED. That's because a FREE request
 * object doesn't need to be saved, and an ALLOCATED request won't valid
 * contents. We don't have all of this information while the transaction is
 * still runnning.
 *
 * If the transaction commits, we need never collect all of these details and
 * can just free the UndoRequest; but if it aborts or is prepared, we need to
 * remember all of these details at that point.
 *
 * If the transaction is aborted by a crash, we need to reconstruct these
 * details after restarting.
 *
 * Note that we don't care about temporary undo, because it can never need
 * to be performed in the background. If the session dies without taking care
 * of permanent or unlogged undo, the associated undo actions still need to
 * be performed at some later point, but the same principle does not apply
 * to temporary undo. All temporary objects disappear with the session that
 * owned them, making the undo irrelevant.
 *
 * fxid should be InvalidTransactionId if and only if the status is set to
 * UNDO_REQUEST_FREE. It identifies the transaction to which this
 * UndoRequestData has been allocated.
